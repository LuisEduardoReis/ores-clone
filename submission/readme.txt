Ores Clone by Luis Eduardo Reis 2018

"./OresClone" is an executable compiled in Ubuntu 16.04. 
It should run as is in Ubuntu.
It needs the folder /res with the game resources in the same folder it is run.

"./code.zip" contains the code for the game.
It is built using cmake, using the C++14 Standard.
It depends upon SDL2 and SDL2_Image.
The dev versions of these libs were used, installed with apt-get.

Additionally the code for the game can be found in the following repository:
